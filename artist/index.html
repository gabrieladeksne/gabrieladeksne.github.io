        <h1>Cocteau Twins</h1>
    </div>
    
    

       
    <p> A Scottish band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, keyboards, programming, producing) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals, lyrics) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (bass, guitar, keyboards, production) in 1983. </p>

    
    <h3>Post-punk, Dreampop, Shoegaze, Etheral, Timeless</h3>
    
    <p>
        Within a few years they were among the most beloved post-punk indie bands in the UK, with a growing international following and a music press that couldn’t quite find the words, and really never did. The twist was they could barely pin it down themselves, much to the frustration of just about every journalist who tried to interview them. Questions of “relevance” seemed lost on them, too. Relevance, as far as Cocteau Twins’ music goes, is truly in the ear of the beholder: It’s what the listener makes of it, whatever the time or place. In most ways, their music remains unmoored from such things—as if they’d lived sealed off from the rest of the world, sending out the occasional musical missive. They existed in a category by themselves—one they created.
